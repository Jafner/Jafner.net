## Note on Reboot procedure
This system has an undiagnosed issue with the RTC/CMOS battery or reset system. When the system *completely* loses power (PSU unplugged, or PSU switch flipped), it will reset the BIOS to default settings *and require keyboard input for the next boot*. 

**If planning to unplug Paladin from power, prepare a keyboard and display to configure the BIOS after booting.**

- Set the clock (RTC).
