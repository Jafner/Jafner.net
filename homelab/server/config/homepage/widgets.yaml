    text: My name is Joey Hafner and this page links to some of the services I host. Jafner.net is my main server, which uses Docker to run all these things. Jafner.tools is hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet. Check out my socials at the bottom. This lab is always changing, and this homepage is too.
