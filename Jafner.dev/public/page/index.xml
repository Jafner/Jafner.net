      <description>Below is a reverse chronological listing of my employment history.&#xA;[2021-11 to 2024-02] Site Reliability Engineer @ American Eagle From November 2021 through February 2024, I worked on a long-term contract with American Eagle to design and implement observability tooling for cloud infrastructure and apps.&#xA;Spearheaded implementation of Bamboo pipelines to automate deployment of New Relic/Terraform observability codebase. That reduced mean-time-to-deployment for our commits by more than 10x. Increased deployment frequency from ~weekly to ~twice daily.</description>

      <description>My name is Joey Hafner. I’m a computing engineer located in Tacoma, WA.&#xA;I’m always working on a diverse array of tech projects. Whether it’s my homelab, or spending 3 hours wrestling with a script to save me 30 seconds.&#xA;I’ve enjoyed hacking with whatever tech I could get my hands on since I was a teen, and that interest was overclocked in 2019 when I found Docker and started my homelab.</description>
