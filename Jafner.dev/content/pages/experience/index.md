Below is a reverse chronological listing of my employment history.

## [2024-02 to 2021-11] Site Reliability Engineer @ American Eagle
From November 2021 through February 2024, I worked on a long-term contract with American Eagle to design and implement observability tooling for cloud infrastructure and apps. 

- Spearheaded implementation of Bamboo pipelines to automate deployment of New Relic/Terraform observability codebase. 
    - That reduced mean-time-to-deployment for our commits by more than 10x.
    - Increased deployment frequency from ~weekly to ~twice daily.
- Collaborated with internal development teams to design human-optimized observability and alerting toolkits.
- Authored and maintained documentation for our New Relic/Terraform codebase.

## [2021-11 to 2021-08] DevOps Engineer @ UpWork Contractor
From August through November 2021, I collaborated with solo- and small-team projects to build automation pipelines, guide offshore software development teams toward client needs, and secure cloud resources to improve security posture. I also implemented data resilience and disaster recovery protocols with attention to ease-of-use and documentation. If you have an UpWork client account, you can view my engineering profile here.

## [2021-08 to 2021-03] Technical Writer @ UpWork Contractor
From March through August 2021, I wrote technical documentation and articles for clients on UpWork. I loved working with open-source project developers to refine and articulate their vision. If you have an UpWork client account, you can view my technical writing profile here.
