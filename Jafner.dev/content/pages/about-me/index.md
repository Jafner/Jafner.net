My name is Joey Hafner. I’m a computing engineer located in Tacoma, WA.

I’m always working on a diverse array of tech projects. Whether it’s my homelab, or spending 3 hours wrestling with a script to save me 30 seconds.

I’ve enjoyed hacking with whatever tech I could get my hands on since I was a teen, and that interest was overclocked in 2019 when I found Docker and started my homelab.

I’m always excited about opportunities to learn new technologies and build useful things.
