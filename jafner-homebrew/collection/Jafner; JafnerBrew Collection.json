					"Rockwyrms are often mistaken for dragons. These reptiles resemble dragons and wyverns, but they tend to be sly and cunning ambushers rather than wide-ranging hunters. Since rockwyrms are careful to slay and devour isolated victims while avoiding groups of creatures, their kills are often blamed on other predators or brigands. Sometimes called \"false dragons,\" rockwyrms have rough hides of mottled gray and brown scales, smallish wings that are more suited for fighting than flying, and blunt faces with powerful jaws and a large third eye in the middle of their foreheads. Rockwyrm foreclaws are nimble enough to serve as hands for most purposes, and their tails are long and powerful.",
					"Rockwyrms are found in cold, mountainous areas across Faerûn. As settlers in the Silver Marches push into the wilderness, and steadings rise in many long-uninhabited places, rockwyrms are becoming an increasing problem. There are even rumors that these hunters work together, shulking and spying, so as to better avoid armed bands and guards and strike at unprotected and isolated targets.",
					"Rockwyrms stash treasure (coins, gems, tools, and other items taken from prey they deem useful for later trade or personal ransom) in rock clefts or hollows that they can conceal and guard with clever traps, but have no single, true lair. They sleep in the same fashion that they hunt-- lying motionless covered by their wings, with their scaly hides matching their surroundings (usually gray rocks or white snow) in hue.",
					"Rockwyrms speak common and draconic, and also master small working vocabularies in many other languages-- depending on what prey they come into contact with."
