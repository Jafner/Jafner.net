When triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack against the first target in its path: {@hit +5} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target; Hit: 11 ({@dice 2d10}) damage. The type of damage depends on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a scything blade does slashing damage, etc.",

The snared creature is restrained (escape DC 13). The cord is AC 10 and has 5 hit points."
